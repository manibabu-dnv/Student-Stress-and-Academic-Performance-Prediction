# 🧠 Student Lifestyle Prediction - Machine Learning Project
This project demonstrates the use of **Machine Learning algorithms** to predict student lifestyle patterns based on a dataset. 
Implemented using R, it includes models such as:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

The project aims to compare these models' performances and provide visual insights into their behavior and predictions.
